Excellent! Your RAG system is now working correctly ðŸŽ‰ The results show that:

1. **Successful Retrieval**: Your system found 3 relevant chunks for "iqama renewal process"
2. **Reasonable Distances**: The distances (0.52-0.57) indicate good similarity matches
3. **Content Relevance**: All results mention Iqama-related topics

## Analysis of Your Results:

**Result 1**: "Tawakkalna application. To do it; To change the Date of Birth of Iqama, the government relations off..."
- **Relevance**: High - directly mentions Iqama date changes
- **Distance**: 0.5206 (best match)

**Result 2**: "How to request postal delivery from Absher? After renewing your Iqama, driving license, Istimara, or..."
- **Relevance**: High - mentions Iqama renewal process
- **Distance**: 0.5416

**Result 3**: "visa fee; You will receive the full refund of the money available in the Absher account within 3 day..."
- **Relevance**: Medium - related to Absher payments (indirectly related to renewal process)
- **Distance**: 0.5665 (weakest match)

## Next Steps to Improve Your System:

### 1. **Improve Chunking Strategy**
```python
# Try different chunking parameters for better context
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=300,  # Smaller chunks for more precise retrieval
    chunk_overlap=75,  # More overlap for better context
    separators=["\n\n", "\n\n", "\n", "\. ", "! ", "? ", " "]
)
```

### 2. **Enhance Query Understanding**
```python
# Add query expansion to handle different phrasings
query_expansions = {
    "iqama renewal process": [
        "iqama renewal steps",
        "how to renew iqama",
        "iqama renewal procedure",
        "renew residency permit Saudi Arabia"
    ]
}

def expand_query(query):
    return query_expansions.get(query, [query]) + [query]
```

### 3. **Add Relevance Filtering**
```python
# Filter out low-similarity results
MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.6  # Adjust based on testing

def filter_results(distances, indices, chunks, metadata):
    filtered_results = []
    for i, (idx, dist) in enumerate(zip(indices[0], distances[0])):
        similarity = 1/(1+dist)  # Convert distance to similarity
        if similarity > MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD and idx < len(metadata):
            filtered_results.append({
                "chunk": chunks[idx],
                "metadata": metadata[idx],
                "similarity": similarity,
                "rank": i+1
            })
    return filtered_results
```

### 4. **Improve Page Attribution**
The fact that all results show "Page 1" suggests the page attribution needs work:

```python
# Enhanced page attribution
def better_page_attribution(chunk, pdf_metadata):
    best_page = 1
    best_overlap = 0
    
    for page_meta in pdf_metadata:
        # Count overlapping words between chunk and page text
        chunk_words = set(chunk.lower().split())
        page_words = set(page_meta['text'].lower().split())
        overlap = len(chunk_words.intersection(page_words))
        
        if overlap > best_overlap:
            best_overlap = overlap
            best_page = page_meta['page']
    
    return best_page
```

### 5. **Test with More Queries**
Now that your system is working, test with more diverse queries:

```python
test_queries = [
    "iqama renewal process",
    "how to renew residency",
    "Absher portal services",
    "visa requirements Saudi Arabia",
    "government fees for iqama"
]

for query in test_queries:
    print(f"\n=== Testing: {query} ===")
    query_embedding = model.encode([query])
    query_embedding_np = np.array(query_embedding).astype('float32')
    distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding_np, k=3)
    
    for i, idx in enumerate(indices[0]):
        if idx < len(all_chunks_metadata):
            meta = all_chunks_metadata[idx]
            print(f"{i+1}. [Page {meta['page']}] {all_chunks[idx][:80]}...")
```

## Deployment Ready!

Your RAG system is now functional. The next steps would be:

1. **Integrate with LLM** for answer generation
2. **Build the Streamlit UI** 
3. **Add multilingual support**
4. **Deploy to cloud**

Would you like me to help you with any of these next steps? Your foundation is solid! ðŸš€
